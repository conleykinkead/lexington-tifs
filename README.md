## Description of the map's creation and purpose
I'm interested in studying gentrification in Lexington; for this project, specifically city-supported projects that contribute to displacement of lower-income residents. Since 2009, Lexington has supported 8 developments through Tax Increment Financing (TIF), a lending strategy that the city turned to to encourage redevelopment of sites that were depressing surrounding property values (Ward and Wood, 2021). I want see how the population size, median housing income, and racial composition of areas near TIF projects have changed from 2010-2020.

Income data from 2010 and 2019 were adjusted to 2022 using the [CPI Inflation Calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. $1.00 in 2010 had the same buying power as $1.36 in 2022; $1.00 in 2019 had the same buying power in as $1.16 in 2022.
